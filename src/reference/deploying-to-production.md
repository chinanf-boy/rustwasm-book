# Deploying Rust and WebAssembly to Production

> **âš¡ Deploying Web applications built with Rust and WebAssembly is nearly
> identical to deploying any other Web application!**

To deploy a Web application that uses Rust-generated WebAssembly on the client,
copy the built Web application's files to your production server's file system
and configure your HTTP server to make them accessible.

## Ensure that Your HTTP Server Uses the `application/wasm` MIME Type

For the fastest page loads, you'll want to use [the
`WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming` function][instantiateStreaming] to pipeline
wasm compilation and instantiation with network transfer (or make sure your
bundler is able to use that function). However, `instantiateStreaming` requires
that the HTTP response has the `application/wasm` [MIME type][] set, or else it
will throw an error.
